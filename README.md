# NACef Code Repository 

Welcome to the NACef (Community-Acquired Pneumonia, Endotypes, and Phenotypes) Code Repository. This repository houses code and resources related to the NACef dataset, a comprehensive collection of clinical information from 768 patients diagnosed with Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) at Clinica Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia. CAP is a significant infectious condition associated with high morbidity and mortality rates during hospitalization. The dataset includes Baseline Clinical Data, In-hospital follow-up, and post-hospital discharge information, captured in the context of a prospective research study, forming an observational cohort in translational medicine. This dataset is a valuable resource for conducting various statistical analyses and educational initiatives, enhancing our understanding of NAC, Endotypes, and Phenotypes.

## Navigating This Repository

This repository is organized to facilitate easy access to the tools and information necessary for working with the NACef dataset. Here's what you can expect to find:

- **Code**: Contains scripts and notebooks that demonstrate how to perform descriptive statistics on the dataset. These resources are designed to help users understand the dataset structure, access data points, and start their analysis.

- **Dataset on Physionet**: For a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including descriptions of variables and details on the data collection process, please visit the corresponding dataset page on Physionet. Here, you can find additional resources to support your research endeavors.
  
- **Data Dictionary**: The data dictionary available in this repository corresponds to the original study design used for data collection at Cl√≠nica Universidad de La Sabana. This version, directly exported from REDCap, is in Spanish. A translated and refined version of the data dictionary, adapted for broader accessibility, is available on Physionet.
