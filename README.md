# NACef Code Repository 

Welcome to the NACef (Community-Acquired Pneumonia, Endotypes, and Phenotypes) Code Repository. This repository houses code and resources related to the NACef dataset, a comprehensive collection of clinical information from 768 patients diagnosed with Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) at Clinica Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia. CAP is a significant infectious condition associated with high morbidity and mortality rates during hospitalization. The dataset includes Baseline Clinical Data, In-hospital follow-up, and post-hospital discharge information, captured in the context of a prospective research study, forming an observational cohort in translational medicine. This dataset is a valuable resource for conducting various statistical analyses and educational initiatives, enhancing our understanding of NAC, Endotypes, and Phenotypes.

## Navigating This Repository

This repository is organized to facilitate easy access to the tools and information necessary for working with the NACef dataset. Here's what you can expect to find:

**Code**:
- Descriptive_Data_NACef.R: Contains scripts and notebooks that shows an example of how to perform descriptive statistics with this dataset. These resources are designed to help users understand the dataset structure, access data points, and start their analysis.

**Documentation**:
- NACef_DataDictionary_RedCap.csv: Original data dictionary exported directly from the REDCap platform used during data collection at Cl√≠nica Universidad de La Sabana. This file reflects the original study design and variable definitions in Spanish. It is provided as a historical reference and documentation of the clinical research process.
- NACef_Metadata_XLM: A structured metadata file describing variable types, formats, and dataset structure.
- NACef_RedCap.pdf: A PDF version of the original REDCap data collection instrument, included for transparency and replication support.
